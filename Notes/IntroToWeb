Objectives
- Understand how the internet works (high level)
- Understand diff b/t front-end and back-end
- View HTML on any given website

Finding the Right Address
    www.udemy.com -> 23.235.47.175
- Your query is submitted to your ISP
- Within your ISP, the DNS takes the Domain name and turns int into an IP Address

Going to That Address
- A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP
- Your request finds the fastest path possible to the server with the specified IP
- This is not a direct journey. It requires hopping from server to server until it's reached it's destination

Server Responsds
- The requested server figures out exactly what we're asking for (/courses)
- The server builds us the right content, often pulling the information from database
- The server responds with any combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

View Page Source
- We can view the underlying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on any webpage
- In Chrome, right click and select "View Page Source"
- Or select View > Developer > View Source

HTTP Requests
    - Foundation of communication on the World Wide webpage
    - "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"
    - Request -> I would like this information please
    - Response -> Ok, here you go!

Web Server
    - A computer* that can satisfy requests on the web
        * "server" is also used to refer to the software running on the computer
    - Responds to client with "instructions"
        - Browser then uses instructions to build web page
Client
    - A computer that accesses a server

HTML5
    Living Standard
        The HTML standard is a document that describes how HTML should work.
    Role of Browsers
        The standard describes the rules of HTML, but browsers actually have to do
        the work and implement HTML according to those rules. 
    HTML5? 
        HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. It includes
        new elements & features for browsers to implement

Inline vs. block elements
    - Inline elements fit in alongside other elements
    - Block level elements take up a whole "block" of space

<div>
    - The content division element
    - A generic container to hold things, or group them together
    - A block element

<span>
    - Generic inline element
    - Very similar to a <div>, but inline

<hr>
    - Horizontal rule element
    - No closing tag, no content, no attribute
    - Makes a dividing line 
    - "A thematic break between elements

<br>
    - Line break element
    
<sup>
    - Superscript element
    - Needs closing tag

<sub> 
    - Subscript element
    - Needs closing tag

<main> 
    - Essentially a <div> but semantically correct for "main" content of page

<header>
    - Essentially a <div> but semantically correct for "header" portion of page

HTML Entities
    - Special codes/sequences that result in different characters
    - e.g. copyright, diamonds, etc.
    - Start with "&"
    - End with ";"
    - e.g. &lt; => "<"
    - Each entity has a name and number

Semantic Markup
    Semantic - relating to meaning
    - Add meaning to Markup
    - Using elements like <main>, <header>, <footer>, etc...

HTML Tables
    - Tables are structured sets of data, made up of rows and columns. 
      They can be a great way of displaying data clearly.
    - In the early days of web, tables were commonly used to create page layouts.
      Today, you should only use the table element when you are creating an actually
      data table.
    - To create a table, you'll use 5-10 different elements. It can be tricky
      to remember them all.

    <table> : holds tabular data
    <td>    : table data (a single cell)
    <tr>    : table row 
    <th>    : column header
    <thead> : wrap headers in this tag for semantics
    <tfoot> : wrap footer in this tag for semantics
    <tbody> : wrap body rows in this tag for semantics.

Creating Forms
    - The <form> element itself is a shell or container that deosn't have any visual impact.
    - We then fill the form with a collection of inputs, checkboxes, buttons, etc.
    - The form element represents a document selection containing interactive controls
      for submitting information.
    - The action attribute specifies WHERE the form data should be sent
    - The method attribute specifies which HTTP method should be used

<input>
    - The input (Form input) element
    - use placeholder="" to clarify input type to user
    - tons of different input types
    - Can have <input type="submit"> to replicate button. Don't do this.
    - radio buttons are linked by their NAME
        - need value="" to send data with radio buttons
<label>
    - Should be linked to an input 
    - makes input more accessible 
    - <input> needs id="cheese"...
    - <label for="cheese"...

<button>
    - Default action is to do form action
    - Button has a type that can be used to change button action
    - button with type=button won't submit, even when in a form 

name attribute
    - name that is used to send data to server
    - i.e. <label name=id>...</label>
        yields ......com/tacos?id=what-the-user-input
    - needs to be used in every single label
    - used by server for data processing

<select>
    - used to group <options> in a dropdown list

<textarea>
    - used for multiline input

Form Validations
    - required attribute makes input required

CSS
---
    - What is it?   
        - CSS is a language for describing how documents are presented visually,
          how they are arranged, and how they are styled
        - CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
        
CSS Selectors
-------------

universal selector:
* {  
    color: pink;
}

element selector:
button {
    color: red;
}

selector list:
h1, h2 {
    color: blue;
}

id selector:
#some-unique-id{
    color: yellow;
}

class selector:
.some-class-name {
    color: magenta;
}

descendant selector:
// can be a removed descendant by several levels of tags... 
li a {  // will only style anchor tags, IF THEY ARE NESTED INSIDE <li>
    color: teal;
}

.class-name a { // anchor tags nested inside class "post"
    color: black;
}

adjacent selector:
a + b {
    // selects all b's directly after a's
}

direct-descendant selector(combinator):
// selects all li that are DIRECT CHILDREN of <div>
div > li {
    color: white;
}

attribute selector:
// select all input elements where the type attribute is set to "text"
input[type="text"] {
    width: 300px;
    color: yellow;
}

pseudo classes:
// keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the 
// selected element(s)
    - : active
    - : checked
    - : first
    - : first-child
    - : hover
    - : not()
    - : nth-child()
    - : nth-of-type()

.post button:hover {
    // when hovering over a button that is in tag with 'post' class
}
.post:nth-of-type(3n){
    // selects every third "post" for all post siblings
    color: blue;
}
.post:nth-of-type(3){
    // selects third "post" for all post siblings
    color: blue;
}

pseudo elements:
// keywords added to a selector that lets you style a particular part of
// selected elements(s)
    - ::after
    - ::before
    - ::first-letter
    - ::first-line
    - :: selection

    p::first-letter {
        // selects first letter of every paragraph
        color: black;
    }
    p::selection {
        // when selecting text in a paragraph...
        background-color: yellow;
    }

css cascade:
// the order your styles are declared in and linked to matters!
// reads top-down!
// this also stands for the html file where the <link> is....
// the first <link> to a css file can be overwritten by content
// in the second <link>

specificity:
// specificity is how the browser decides which rules apply when multiple rules
// could apply to the same element. 
// it is a measure of how specific a given selector is. The more specific
// selector wins.

    specificity guide
    id > class > element

css inheritance:
// can set property to inherit, 
button {
    color: inherit;
}

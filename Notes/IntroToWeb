Finding the Right Address
    www.udemy.com -> 23.235.47.175
- Your query is submitted to your ISP
- Within your ISP, the DNS takes the Domain name and turns int into an IP Address

Going to That Address
- A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP
- Your request finds the fastest path possible to the server with the specified IP
- This is not a direct journey. It requires hopping from server to server until it's reached it's destination

Server Responsds
- The requested server figures out exactly what we're asking for (/courses)
- The server builds us the right content, often pulling the information from database
- The server responds with any combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

View Page Source
- We can view the underlying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on any webpage
- In Chrome, right click and select "View Page Source"
- Or select View > Developer > View Source

HTTP Requests
    - Foundation of communication on the World Wide webpage
    - "Hyper Text Transfer Protocol"
    - Request -> I would like this information please

Client

HTML5
    Living Standard
        The HTML standard is a document that describes how HTML should work.
    Role of Browsers
        The standard describes the rules of HTML, but browsers actually have to do
        the work and implement HTML according to those rules. 
    HTML5? 
        HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. It includes
        new elements & features for browsers to implement
